# Rotating-platform

The rotating platform can be used to take pictures of items for online auctions or to generate 3d models.

All parameters can be entered using my own android application.

The software allows rotation in both directions. 
After specifying the number of photos, rotation by a certain angle is performed automatically. 
The camera's shutter is also forced automatically.
